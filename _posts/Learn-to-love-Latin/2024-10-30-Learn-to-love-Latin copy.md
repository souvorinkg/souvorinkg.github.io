After meeting with our client for ISeeGreen, we established a list of priorities for the project’s development going forward. There needs to be a way for her to test the project locally, so we will need to host it on ASP. Predictive text on the family and genera would help save time and prevent spelling mistakes. Having a spell check for common families and genera would also be useful. There should be a checkbox style way to add plants to a list from the start screen. Finally, there should be a simple way to add plants from a csv. Our client feels that the ability to make personalized lists is what sets this site apart from its competitors and should be the focus going forward. 

She is not interested in pictures, descriptions, tagging by region, tagging by native status, or having associated common names.

This *Hesperocyparis macrocarpa* is known as the "Lone Cypress," and is the most photographed tree in the United States.

Currently, the site is not being hosted, so we will need to determine whether Disco Tray Studios would pay for such a project. A coworker is already working on autocomplete, going forward, I will work on getting a checkbox set up for adding to lists.
