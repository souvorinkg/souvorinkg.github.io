As a member of Disco Tray Studios, I had the rewarding opportunity to contribute to the development of the [Hendrix Commencement](https://github.com/DiscoTrayStudios/CommencementSeating) Website, a dynamic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) platform crafted using ASP.NET with C#. Our team embarked on this project with enthusiasm, recognizing the significance of creating a seamless virtual space to commemorate the achievements of Hendrix College graduates. Leveraging the capabilities of ASP.NET and C#, we meticulously designed and implemented features that streamline the commencement process, from registration to post-event reflections, ensuring a smooth experience for users. One of our primary objectives was to create a seating chart feature, allowing administrators to efficiently arrange seating for the graduation ceremony. Through collaborative effort and innovative problem-solving, we developed a user-friendly interface that enables administrators to easily assign seats to graduates and attendees, making real-time updates as needed. This feature not only streamlines the logistical aspects of organizing a large-scale event but also enhances the overall experience for everyone involved, ensuring a smooth and memorable commencement ceremony.

In conclusion, our work on the Hendrix Commencement Website represents a culmination of dedication, innovation, and expertise in web development. Through collaborative effort and meticulous attention to detail, we have successfully crafted a platform that not only fulfills its intended purpose but also exceeds expectations, providing graduates, attendees, and administrators with a seamless and enriching experience.
