[The Hendrix Arboretum](https://arboretum.hendrix.edu/) is a project dating back to 1995 when the Hendrix biology department began cataloging the location and species of trees within the Hendrix Campus. Today, over 1,000 trees and 80 species have been cataloged. Each tree in the database has an image and species. Each species is mapped to a scientific name and names common to the Central Arkansas region. The census is growing to include all species common to Arkansas and neighboring states.

The Hendrix Arboretum was initially built by the school's Biology Department for internal use. Now, a wide variety of Hendrix students, faculty, as well as scientists and enthusiasts from the greater Arkansas community, use the Arboretum. The website satisfies the esoteric user, by including GPS coordinates and taxonomical information about a wide variety of common and rare species in Arkansas, as well as being accessible to hobbyists, and is a successful example of scientific communication. Both groups maintain and grow the database of images. The purpose is a digital education resource and a time capsule for the entire Central Arkansas community.

As a member of Disco Tray Studios, I have continued work on the Hendrix Arboretum website. Currently, the website is managed by Dr. Sutherland and has been successfully deployed in its first iteration. Now, we are working to make the website easier to edit, administer, and use. The goal is for our client, Dr. Sutherland, and future administrators, to be able to maintain and add to the website as a turnkey, not requiring any knowledge of the logic of the database and DOM. Not every client will come from a programming background, so making this project maintainable by novice users is an interesting challenge and an important aspect of accessibility.
