This week, I began to work on the ISeeGreen website, that tracks important information about trees. However, we don't really have useful info about the trees yet. Currently, we have scientific names and some ID's useful for government purposes. To make this website work for more people, I talked to a variety of biolgists, arboriststs, and gardeners about what they would want to do with our dataset. They wanted range of plants, maps of plnats, native status, soil type, and common blights. 

We needed an API to get this information, I ended up settling on perenual.com, which offers a free plan of 100 API calls per day. Right now, I can get a generic tree's information, I am close to getting a specific tree's information, which will greatly increase the usability of the site.
